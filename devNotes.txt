Commit 1: 
file reader method set up and log message works properly

Commit 2:
token list created as enum in src/lexer/token.ts
is this token list complete? 
Do I need to add digits and charecters?

Goal:
Check for valid keywords, identifiers, symbols, digits, charecters

steps
Charecter has
	-position (Line and number)
	-content
	-parents
	-expected partner (open brace expects closed brace, quotations, etc)
	
Token has
	-start position
	-end position
	-content
	
	
We need to read charecters, sorth them into tokens, and check their validity

test cases will be in local folder but can be any name or extension
