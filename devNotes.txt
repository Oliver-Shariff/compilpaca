Commit 0:
project structure intailaized
there might be issues with where JS code generates
how to implement dist folder?

Commit 1: 
file reader method set up and log message works properly

Commit 2:
token list created as enum in src/lexer/token.ts
is this token list complete? 
Do I need to add digits and charecters?

Goal:
Check for valid keywords, identifiers, symbols, digits, charecters

steps
Charecter has
	-position (Line and number)
	-content
	-parents
	-expected partner (open brace expects closed brace, quotations, etc)
	
Token has
	-start position
	-end position
	-content
	
	
We need to read charecters, sorth them into tokens, and check their validity

test cases will be in local folder but can be any name or extension

previous work was mostly wrong but rereading the chapter and instructions I understand better

**New Branch** - newStruct

Structure of project changes to use browser and remove node-modules from git

lexer directory removed and lexer.ts and index.ts places in source folder

Now I'll move the enum I created earlier (and backed up locally) to lexer.ts

lexer.ts should also do the following:

	define token structure (type, value, position (line and column?))
	distinguish between tokens with RegEx formulas
	take and input (test code) and 'tokenize' what it gets. ie use the structure and regex to assign what it reads as valid or invalid tokens
	find errors and warnings
	log the output accordingly

index.ts

	create JS for index.html.


QUESTIONS:

Does the grammar allow for multi digit numbers?
